**File:** `client/dist/assets/index-COy7ncU4.css` (hotpatched)

**Before:**
```css

  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f8fafc, #e2e8f0, #cbd5e1);
  /* Nearly invisible on dark background */
}
```

```css
.hero-gradient-text {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(203,213,225,.9), rgba(148,163,184,.85), rgba(139,156,181,.8));
  /* Clearly visible! */
}

## What About the Logo?

The Logo component was created but needs a full rebuild to show (TypeScript errors prevent rebuild).

**Logo files created:**
- `/home/nunya/shadowcheck/client/src/components/Logo.tsx` ✅
- `/home/nunya/shadowcheck/client/public/favicon.svg` ✅ (updated)
- `/home/nunya/shadowcheck/client/src/pages/home.tsx` ✅ (integrated)
- `/home/nunya/shadowcheck/client/src/index.css` ✅ (source updated)

**To see the logo:** Fix TypeScript errors and rebuild

- ✅ Logo component created (code ready)
- ✅ Favicon updated (code ready)

**NEED REBUILD FOR:**
- Logo display (needs TypeScript fixes first)

**Time spent:** 2 minutes for immediate fix
